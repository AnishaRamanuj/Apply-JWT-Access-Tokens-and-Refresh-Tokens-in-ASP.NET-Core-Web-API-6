# TasksApi
##### A simple API built in ASP.NET Core Web API 6, connecting SQL Server Express database with EF Core and using JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
##### We will use the latest and greatest version of Visual Studio 2022 – Community Edition to build our ASP.NET Core Web API using the fastest .NET Standard framework which is .NET 6 and C# 10.

##### The good news is that VS 2022 comes bundled with the latest version of .NET and C#, so you don’t have to worry about searching and installing any of them. So, if you haven’t got VS 2022 already, make sure you download and install Visual Studio 2022 so we can get started with our tutorial to Apply JWT Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens in ASP.NET Core Web API 6.
